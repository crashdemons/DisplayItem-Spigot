# DisplayItem-Spigot
DisplayItem-Spigot is a ground-up rewrite of the old [DisplayItem by LMBishop](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/▶-displayitem-◀-share-your-item-in-chat-by-saying-item.28931/).

DisplayItem is used for sharing items in chat messages with hoverable information about the item.

Message appearance, information, and compatibility with other chat plugins is configurable. Please check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/crashdemons/DisplayItem-Spigot/wiki).

This plugin is for use in Spigot 1.13+ and higher (uses BungeeChat components in Spigot-API).
